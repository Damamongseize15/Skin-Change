The program allows you to use **any skins, back bling, pickaxes, and gliders** completely free of charge.

- ✅ **Changing cosmetics**: Outfits, Emotes, Pickaxes, Gliders, Wraps, Back Bling.
- ✅ **Simple interface** – convenient menu after pressing the INSERT button.
- ✅ **Regular updates** – compatibility with the latest patches of Fortnite 2026.
- ✅ **No ban** – the code does not interfere with the game process, only changes visual data in the RAM.
- ✅ **Lightweight** – the program weighs less than 15 MB and runs on any PC.

## 🚀 How to Install and Use?

The installation process takes literally 1 minute:

1. **Download** the archive using the button at the top of the page.
2. **Unzip** the archive to any convenient folder (for example, on your Desktop).
3. **Run** the file `.exe` (must be done **as administrator**).

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Will I get banned?**
A: The tool operates on the principle of memory editing (like external trainers). It does not inject into game files, which minimizes the risk of an automatic anti-cheat (EAC) ban. However, 100% safety cannot be guaranteed.

**Q: Can other players see my skin?**
A: No. The replacement works **client-side** (only you see the changes). This is a visual mod.

**Q: Why does the antivirus delete the file?**
A: This is a false positive. All files are packed to reduce size, which triggers antivirus heuristics. Add the program to your exclusions.

**Q: Does the skin changer work on consoles (PlayStation/Xbox)?**
A: No, the tool only works on the Windows PC version of Fortnite.

**Q: Where is the password for the archive?**
A: Most often it's `2026` or `fnskinchanger`. If you downloaded the archive from a third-party source, look for the password in the description of that post.
